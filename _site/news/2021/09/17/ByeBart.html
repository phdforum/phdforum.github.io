<p>This Friday we bid adieu to another one of our founding member, Bart van Ginkel. Bart has been instrumental in all our activities and is the best host we had for our forum meetings. Apart from this, he chaired our board meetings after Roel left and did a phenomenal job in having an efficient and fruitful meeting. Infact, he was one of the pioneers in bringing a ‘very Dutch’ organized way in our board meetings.</p>

<p>We will surely miss Bart a lot and especially, his due diligence which gave us a sense of calm that our forum meetings would go smoothly. Bart will be replaced by Simone Floreani from the Probabilty group. Simone is a 4th year PhD student working with Frank Redig. We are thrilled to have Simone onboard and look forward to his innovative ideas for our forum meetings.</p>
