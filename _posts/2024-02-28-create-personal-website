As an academic, it is very important to have an online presence. It is recommended to have a personal web page, and your personal TU Delft page should be up to date, since this is often the first search result on Google. We have invited Joffrey Wallaart and Emiel Lorist to explain to us how to set these things up in the easiest way possible, no extra programming skills required. Emiel will also discuss what content should be put on your website, because that is just as important.
 
The forum will be held on the 28th of February, 16:00-17:00 in the Snijderszaal (LB 01.010). As usual, we will have drinks afterwards, this time at X Cafe.
 
If you bring your laptop, you will be able to follow along with Joffrey’s explanation of the personal TU Delft page. So if you don’t have a personal web page, a personal TU Delft page, or if you want to improve them, join us for the next forum on February 28th!
