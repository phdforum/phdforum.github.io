In this PhD Forum we will have a workshop on science communication organised by [Mariette Oosterwegel](https://samenweten.nl/en/2021/09/nog-een-bericht/) from [Samenweten](https://samenweten.nl/en/), which is an initiative of the Dutch Royal Academy of Sciences ([KNAW](https://www.knaw.nl/en?set_language=en)). The workshop is divided in two parts. In the first half, Mariette will discuss the importance of science communication with an interactive session. In the second half, three scientists with experience in science communication will form a panel and share their stories and answer questions from the audience (=us!). The three experts we have invited are
- [Klaas Landsman](https://www.math.ru.nl/~landsman/) (Radboud University Nijmegen)
- [Eline van der Kruk](https://elinevanderkruk.com) (TU Delft)
- [Anne Land](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/anne-land-zandstra#tab-1) (Leiden University)

At the end of the workshop (around 17:30) we will have drinks and bites at the /Pub in EWI offered by the department.
