Do you know what your colleagues from other research groups are doing? It could be that you share research interests with someone from a section you would never suspect… It’s time to find out! This time we will have the Statistics and Numerical Analysis groups.

The program for this Forum is the following:

16:00 opening

16:05 introduction to the Statistics group by Andrea

16:10 talks by Marc Corstanje and Bart Eggen

16:25 introduction to the Numerical Analysis group by Marieke

16:30 talks by Daniel Hoonhout and Leila Hashemi

16:50 Speed dating!


P.S.  For those of you who are not familiar with our speed dating event: we will create breakout rooms and randomly assign two people to each room for a short amount of time (around 4 minutes). This is repeated 3 or more times randomly picking new pairs every time.
