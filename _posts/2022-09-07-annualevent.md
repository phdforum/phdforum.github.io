Have you ever wondered what your post-phd life could look like? Still doubting between a career in industry or academia? This is the moment to ask all your questions during a Q&A session with alumni!

After this session, a social-event will take place. Here, state-of-the-art algorithms will be used to maximize the social interaction within the breakout rooms!


The tentative schedule for the meeting is as follows:

16:00 Introduction of the DIAM PhD forum and discussion of survey results

16:10 Q&A session with alumni (from academia and industry)

16:55 Wrap-up

17:00 Social event (using “breakout rooms”)
