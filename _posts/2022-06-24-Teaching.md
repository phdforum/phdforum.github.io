Almost all of the PhD students are involved in educational activities during their PhD-project and some of us might even think of becoming a full-time lecturer after graduation. During this PhD Forum, you will get the opportunity to hear more about best practices in the classroom, (digital) innovation in mathematical courses, and reasons to start a career in teaching from experienced teachers at TU Delft.   

We will host a panel discussion with 3 teachers from the TU Delft. The panel will consist of Fokko van der Bult and Marleen Keijzer, both full time lecturers at DIAM, and Calvin Rans, Associate Professor at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, who also won the ‘Best Teacher of the Netherlands’ Award in 2019. We will prepare questions but we hope to have an interactive discussion with all of you. 

Before the panel discussion, Tom Vroegrijk, Programme Manager of PRIME, will give a short presentation to introduce PRIME and talk about their mission on educational innovation. At the end of the meeting, we will go for drinks!
