This Friday we bid adieu to another one of our founding members, Bart van Ginkel. Bart has been instrumental in all our activities and was a very important member of our team. He also chaired our board meetings after Roel left and did a phenomenal job in having an efficient and fruitful meeting. Infact, he was one of the pioneers in bringing a 'very Dutch' organized way in our board meetings. 

We will surely miss Bart a lot! We wish him good luck with his PhD defence, which is going to take place on Thursday 14 October.

Bart will be replaced by Simone Floreani from the Probabilty group. Simone is a 4th year PhD student working with Frank Redig. We are thrilled to have Simone onboard and look forward to his innovative ideas for our forum meetings.
