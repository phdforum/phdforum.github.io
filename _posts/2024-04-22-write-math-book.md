We are pleased to have Dr. Raffaella Mulas from VU and Dr. Cornelis Kraaikamp from TU Delft to share their experience about writing a math book. Dr. Raffaella Mulas, currently assistant professor at VU, has written books for mathematicians and children and Dr. Cornelis Kraaikamp, currently associate professor at TU Delft, has rich experience in textbook writing, apart from their very long lists of research and outreach articles.
 
We will also have the chance to ask questions and discuss with any of the speakers.
