In this PhD Forum, we have Dennis Palagin, who is a Data Steward and HPC Specialist at [Delft High Performance Computing Centre](https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc). Dennis is going to introduce DelftBlue and most importantly he will give us a detailed introduction on how to use the supercomputer yourself. The workshop is tailor-made such that it is interesting for every PhD student of DIAM, regardless of the programming language you are using or the skills that you have. After this workshop, we will all be able to use the power of DelftBlue for our numerical simulations! 
 
We invite you to bring your own laptop if you would like to try to use the supercomputer following Dennisâ€™ steps.
 
Afterwards, we will have drinks at PSOR, the pub of Civil Engineering.
