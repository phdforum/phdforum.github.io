In this Forum we want to share our experiences on how to have useful interactions with fellow researchers. We invited two (former) PhD students to give a talk about this topic and tell us how interactions can lead to research collaborations. After hearing their stories, we will have a group discussion.

The tentative schedule for the meeting is as follows:

16:00 Introduction

16:05 Introduction to the SIAM student chapter Delft by the new board

16:10 Talks by Mikola Schlottke and Vandana Dwarka

16:30 Group discussion

16:50 Social event (using “breakout rooms”)

As you know very well by now, we like to conclude our meetings with a social activity. This time, we will do a speed dating event, in which you will have the chance to talk one on one with several colleagues for a few minutes each.


The [notes](/../presentations/notes.pdf) of our group discussion are also available.
