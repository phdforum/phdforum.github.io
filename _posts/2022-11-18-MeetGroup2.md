Do you know what your colleagues from other research groups are doing? It could be that you share research interests with someone from a section you would never suspect… It’s time to find out! This time we will start from the Analysis and Probability groups. We will have Vicente Lenz and Hidde van Wiechen from Applied probability and Joshua Willems and MatthijsVernooij from Analysis to give us a short overview of the people in their groups and their (and their colleagues') reaserach areas.

The tentative schedule for the meeting is as follows:

16:00 Introduction

16:05 Introduction to Applied Probability group

16:30 Introduction to the Analysis group

17:00 Social event (using “breakout rooms”)
