In this Forum, we will discuss the ‘PhD path’ with a panel of professors from different departments of DIAM: Jan van Neerven (Analysis), Henk Schuttelaars (Mathematical Physics) and Alessandra Cipriani (Applied Probability). Topics that will be treated are research, time-management and personal life, networking, and post-PhD applications for new positions. The panel will talk about their own experiences as a PhD student, but also about experiences gained later in their career, for instance as a supervisor.

The panel talk will last for around 1 hour. Afterwards, we will do another round of speed dating.


The program for this Forum is the following:

16:00 opening

16:05 Introduction of the panel

16:10 Discussion forum

17:00 Speed dating!


P.S.  For those of you who are not familiar with our speed dating event: we will create breakout rooms and randomly assign two people to each room for a short amount of time (around 4 minutes). This is repeated 3 or more times randomly picking new pairs every time.
